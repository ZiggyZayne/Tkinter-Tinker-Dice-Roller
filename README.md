# Tkinter-Tinker-Dice-Roller
While learning Tkinter I decided to do what I do best, which is to make a dice roller of course! I basically just made a billion buttons and new window functions with the random.randint() function. Great times!
Not much to it really, just a bunch of buttons and stuff! It could be better, for sure!
